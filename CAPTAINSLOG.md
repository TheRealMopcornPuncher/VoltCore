A silly concept accidentally turned into reality
Pitch: An extra portable and partially remote solution to printing without an active power source

# Day 0 - Preparations and planning
### Feb 4, 2025

I began by generating a timeline for me to operate within, as to avoid procrastinating and not finishing the project at all.

**Deadline: Feb 11**

- Finalize battery system and power management.
- Generate a rough BOM (electronics, motors, extruder, frame materials, etc.).
- Confirm which parts I can salvage from my spare Sovol SV01 Pro.
- Research and select a control board + firmware (e.g., Klipper or Marlin).

**Deadline: March 31** _(Finalized Design & Parts Ordered)_

- Design a CoreXY frame in CAD, ensuring it satisfies a small size profile (X and Y dimensions are 6-7 inches).
- Simulate motion system (belt routing, pulley positioning, etc.).
- Plan the mounting locations for electronics and battery.
- **Finalize the design and order all necessary parts.**

**Deadline: April 14** _(All Parts Arrived & Assembly Begins)_

- Assemble the frame and install motors, belts, and pulleys.
- Wire up the control board and power system.
- Perform first motion tests (homing, jogging, etc.).
- Mount and test the extruder and hot end (ensure >220Â°C capability).
- **All parts should be in by this date to stay on track.**

**Deadline: April 28**

- Flash firmware and configure motion system.
- Tune CoreXY kinematics and stepper settings.
- Ensure power consumption is within acceptable limits.
- Run first test prints and refine print quality.

**Deadline: May 4** _(Final Benchy Print Verified & Ready to Ship)_

- Complete final tuning and ensure prints are high quality.
- Verify folding mechanism and portability.
- Confirm battery efficiency for the intended use.
- **Must have a successful Benchy print by this date!**

**Deadline: May 6** _(Ship Everything or Carry it with You)_

- Pack the printer securely for shipping.
- Ensure documentation and necessary tools are included.
- Consider taking it as a carry-on for guaranteed arrival.

Besides this, I've also done some research on suitable parts. Mostly minimal.

# Day 1
### Feb 5, 2025

I felt pretty energized with the project today so I decided to start working on pushing my project into the tank with the others. (Started writing and journaling today, the previous entry was made up for yesterday.) I intend to jot some stuff down into the BOM and continue fleshing out my solution for power. Mostly stuff from my first deadline/checkpoint.
